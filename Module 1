What is Hacking ....?

Accessing a protected resource without any authentication / authorization is known as hacking.

Pillars of Security

Confidentiality	(encryption)// data should not be visible to unauthorized people.

Integrity	(Hashing)// data should not be tampered

Availability	(Backups, Proper security mechanisms)// due to security issues, data transmission should not be interrupted.	Ex:DOS

Authenticity	(1, 2 authentication)// should not be able to access anything unless aunthenticated.

Non-Repudation	(Logs)// user cannot deny his activity, every major activity should be logged.

Types Of Hackers///

Black Hat : hacker trying to HARM
White Hat : hacker trying to Protect Pentester, Security Analyst
Gray Hat  : hacker trying to do both.

Script Kiddies: just work on tool, with no knowledge on hacking.

5 Phases of Hacking.

1. Information Gathering	//Collecting As much as info about your target.70% of your time
					//Nmap, Mass Scan

2. Exploitation	/ Gaining Access	// getting a low privileged access.
						//Core impact - Metasploit
3. Privilege Escalation		// Elevating your access from lower privileges to higher p rivileges Guest-Admin
						// meterpreter script for post/multi/recon/local_exploit_suggestor
4. Creating Backdoor 	// Maintaining Access	

5. Clearing Footprints / Clearing logs / Covering Tracks

Pre Exploitation / Information Gathering / Reconnaissance
Exploitation
Post Exploitation

Robber => Hacker

Money => Data

Bank  => Computer / Server

Windows
Guest -> Standard User -> Admin -> NT Authority(H)
Guest -> Domain User -> Local Admin -> Domain Admin >  NT Authority(H)

Unix
Guest -> User -> Sudo User* -> Root(H)

Few Terminologies of Hacking (Security Language)

Vulnerability : a loop hole or weakness which exists on a computer, any device, protocol, scripts, program etc.
Ex: glass door

Payload : a script or tool which is used to exploit 
Ex: Hammer, stone

Exploit : its an attack or breach done utilizing a vulnerability
Ex: entering into to the Bank

Bot : is a backdoor setup by a hacker on a previously compromised machine.

Doxing: publishing privately identified info (usually found by hacking) and posting it into social networks, or internet.
