Information Gathering
-> Passive IG	M2
-> Active IG M3,M4,M5

-> Passive IG	M2 / Usually Web based Targets, For Social Engineering 
Attacks.

Most Common Targets: Websites, Devices Accessible through Internet

Agenda For Feb-15-2020
Active Information Gathering

Scanning	// Port Scanning
Enumeration	// Gathering services leaking information
Vulnerability Scanning	// how to identify vulnerabilities of the machine.

// Scanning			//Port Scan

Logical Ports // Non Physical Port used to communicate with another computer.

Ports used to connect your computer with other computer for a network activity
65535 Ports
Sockets => IP:Port
127.0.0.1:8080	=> traffic

Protocols =>

TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) & UDP (User Datagram Protocol)

SYN	// Synchronization this flag is used to initiate the connection
ACK	// Acknowledgement used to acknowledge that data is received
RST	// Reset used to reset the connection.
FIN	// Finish used to initiate the end of the communication
URG	// Urgent used to specify the priority of the data during transmission.
PSH	// Push used to specify the priority of the data to be processed by the CPU.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_TCP_and_UDP_port_numbers

1-1023 Well known / Reserved Ports	//few ports standardized for specific services	
		Ex: HTTP-80,FTP-21,SSH-22,SMTP-25,SMB-445,SNMP-161

1024 - 49151 Vendor Specific Ports / Registered Ports
		Microsoft 3389 RDP, Mysql 3306, Postgresql 5432. 

49152 - 65535 Dynamic Ports

192.168.1.1/24

192.168.1.1 - 192.168.1.254 /24

192.168.1.1 - 192.168.254.254 /16

192.1.1.1 - 192.254.254.254 /8


Practical Ports Scanning
Identify whether target machine is up or not
identify Open Ports
identify Services running on those open ports
identify O.S running
identify Information Leakage	// not traditionally used in port scanner
identify Vulnerabilities *	// not traditionally used in port scanner

nmap is the well knowned and most commonly used port scanner

zenmap is gui version of nmap

live website to perform Port Scanning
http://scanme.nmap.org/
any machine on your network
192.168.1.1-192.168.1.254

Nmap / Port Scanning States

open		// the concerned port is open and receiving communication
closed		// the concerned port is closed and not receiving communication
filtered	// some application or configuration is filtering out / stopping data transfer

Assignments:...?
perform port Scanning on
windows 2012,
windows 8
kali linux
ubuntu

1.what ports are open
2.what are the services running on those machine.
How port Scanning works: 
http://etutorials.org/Networking/network+security+assessment/Chapter+4.+IP+Network+Scanning/4.2+TCP+Port+Scanning/

Ip address:
Operating System:
Ports Open:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

// Enumeration
will probe the open port to get more info about target.

445 (SMB) Server Message Block,	shares, username, accuracte o.s version
161,162 (SNMP)Simple Network Management Protocol	system info, programs installed, Usernames, network info,

1.No Auth
2.Community Strings(Password)
	Public, Private

139(TCP),137(UDP)NetBIOS system name
//
	
smbclient	// this would list and help you to view publicly shared files without authentication.

=> smbclient 	// is tool to probe smb port and get info
=> smbclient -L <target-ip> -N	// will list all shares enabled in the machine
=> enum4linux -a <target-ip>	// perform detailed enumeration on target machine

=> nmap -p 445 <target-ip> --script=smb*	// will execute all smb based scripts on target
=> nmap -p 445 <target-ip> --script=smb-enum-*
=> nmap -p 445 <target-ip> --script=smb-vuln-*

=> nbtscan -r <ip-range>	// to get system's name of the entire network range

=> netdiscover

=> locate *.nse | grep <service name>

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Vulnerability Scanning:

Vulnerability Assessment ,Vulnerability Management

lookout for loopholes or  on your target.

1. RCE (Remote Code Execution)// any thing but should write code for it.
2. Command Execution. //only executes command allowed by the o.s for the designated user
3. DOS (Denial Of Service) // Which blocks the authorized user from accessing it.
4. Backdoor	ES file explorer, CCleaner, Cam Scanner
5. Information disclosure (85%)

In RCE attacker will be able to execute any code on the victim machine without authentication remotely.

After a vulnerability is reported:

Fixing can be done.
Fixing cannot be done

true positives		rightly stating vulnerability exists
true negatives		rightly stating vulnerability doesnot exists
false negatives		wrongly stating the vulnerability doesnot exists
false positives.	wrongly stating the vulnerability exists
